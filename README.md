# Eye-Movement
## This project creates a pair of eyes that pop up once the page loads, and then tracks and follows the movement of the mouse to seem like it is staring at it.
### My plan for the future of this project is quite simple. I would like to create a full face that will follow the movement of the mosue as well. I would like it to be able to change direction, but for now I will work on creating a face using css elements.
